this is due to the short lived cheaper lasers they put in them .	i drop them ,  push them off counters ,  and they fall off fenders i put them on .  .  . hey ,  it happens .	0

i miss my days of cracker eating before becoming gluten free .	it withstood being knocked to the floor by my bad cats several times before becoming seriously unreliable .	0
both rub my dog raw and cause bleeding .	i then rub the bird with the rub of my choice .	0

overall it is inconvenient to keep the counter and the unit clean .	i keep four felt circles under it to keep it slightly off the counter .	0
it s this second part that really grosses me out .	if the thought of dust and lint constantly being on your phone grosses you out ,  don t get this .	0
because these knives will greatly appreciate on the collector s market .	the guys will appreciate this . as a woman ,  i appreciate the compact look ,  the smooth feel and the color choice .	0

this is a good hoodie and well made .	work well ,  look good ,  seem well made and will probably last a long time .	0
it s very black ,  and it does add volume .	the steps are simple in principle ,  add the filter ,  add the coffee ,  add the water and wait .	0

first ,  and surprising was that they have removeable sole inserts .	upon holding it for the first time ,  my first impression was how smooth and slick the case was .	0
however ,  i feel civilization iv is most definitely not an improvement overall .	it doesn t quite feel like leather .  .  . maybe something like hard pleather ,  but it definitely feel quality .	0
avoid the heartache and wasted titme of bad discs .	i ve spent the difference in price on discs and discs holder . p . s .	0
but this stuff will fall apart after only a few washings .	unlike some take apart scissors these are easy to reassemble but don t fall apart when you are using them .	0
company will exchange though but it wastes your time doing this .	i ll need another though ,  probably will do a better job about checking into the charging port next time though .	0
lasted for two games ,  during which i was the sole operator .	my first was a cuisinart which was a good enough machine that lasted many years ,  then just wore out .	0
very hard plastic and not that fun to play with at all .	it s hard to put together ,  hard to turn the handle ,  hard to take apart ,  and hard to clean .	0
save yourself some time and money and skip this product .	if you have the time and patience you can save yourself a lot of money by doing it yourself .	0
a process that takes a couple of minutes .	the entire process takes about ten minutes and absolutely transforms the epic .	0
i love cheetos and any artificially or naturally enhanced cheese snack .	love love love this unit . i love egg salad .	0
hardly something i would give as a wrapped birthday gift .	wrapped and ribboned i think that would make an attractive gift .	0

don t waste your time or money on these jeans .	vegetables taste fresh and also come out great .	0
i first used it on my hands and fingers .	i would keep my fingers crossed ,  but ,  i can t make tea with my fingers crossed  joking  .	0
i also have to hold the headphone cord to keep it from flapping around .	i also like the coiled cord ,  as it means i don t have a long cord hanging around my console .	0
not the fastest but better than my other hot air brush .	was it better than coffee kept hot on a hot plate surface ?  is air lighter than gravel .	0
i threw it out because i can t take alcohol .	a little rubbing alcohol will take the labels off if you need to change them out .	0
after that you have to pay a subscription .	i got this set at least num_num years ago originally ,  and loved it .	0
there s no way this will last as long as claimed .	there s no seams ,  so there s no way that this ladle can fall apart .	0
i will still continue to use philosophy products ,  just not this one .	i absolutely love this case ,  and will continue to use otterbox products .	0
certainly one of the more widely produced in the us .	they are certainly more durable than the retractable cables ,  but still take up no more space .	0
just reinstall the previous ghost recon and raven shield games .	i recommend this phone shield because it is the best phone shield available and it has a lifetime warranty .	0
all of them are utter garbage ,  not even decent polyester .	just put them on a cutting board with plastic wrap over them ,  and pound them into an even thickness .	0
i d suggest anyone looking to purchase linksys products look into netgear instead .	instead of buying a set ,  i instead decided to purchase individua pieces that fit my needs .	0
good thing filters for num_num gallon tanks are cheap .	call num_num num_num num_num num_num num_num num_num num_extend and it does .	0
i might return it ,  but i need a can opener .	anything else you might need might be for more specialty kind of stuff .	0
instead i would recommend cetaphil gentle cleanser and you will be fine .	camera works fine ,  sensors work fine ,  volume buttons work fine .	0
sugar is extremely addictive and does absolutely nothing for your body .	i ve ground coffee of varying degrees of coarseness and i ve also ground whole grain brown sugar into confectionary sugar .	0
i d rather tie a towel around my neck as a cape .	also ,  the rigid band that goes around the back of my head doesn t interfere much with my neck .	0
the constriction on my dog caused him to sit .	now i can get him new brews to try as other gifts for him .	0
the case fit okay but not attractive at all .	good case but my galaxy nexus will hardly fit ,  have to push to make it fit .	0
as i get hit ,  my health endurance goes down .	my husband is disabled and is unable to get down and get anything from this cabinet .	0
they would flip off or get hung up due to poorly rolling wheels .	i would turn it off and it would pop up even when i had it turned off .	0
one thing is the amazingly poor unit a . i .	i only wanted one unit and one of my riding buddies only wanted one as well .	0
i expected an improvement in signal strength from my tiny usb direct plugin type .	i am awful when it comes to using the rolling pin to make a circle .	0

for some reason it worked out terribly for me .	for some reason the steam never comes out for me without the salt .	0
amazon does not provide enough information about this press .	the angle of illumination from an overhead kitchen light does not provide enough contrast to read the lcd .	0
multiplayer is just as bad ,  though thankfully not worse .	just looks really bad . the lid died very shortly after purchasing though .	0
i was bored after the first num_num minutes .	within num_num minutes ,  it was at % charge; num_num minutes ,  % and num_num minutes ,  %	0

th product features and editorial review spell germany as the origin of manufacture .	so ,  you ll have to decide for yourself if this belkin product s following features outweigh the features mentioned above .	0
it didn t work for me hopefully other people will have better luck .	it was kinda funny watching people watch other people trying to figure out what to do with it .	0
flavor :  it has some tangy notes ,  and overall not bad .	bad design ,  bad directions ,  sales hype all add up to bad products .	0
mine is a piece of junk ,  as far as i am concerned .	couldn t be happier ! the phone should have come with this battery as far as i am concerned .	0
would have been alot nicer if it simply threaded in with the correct alignment .	this would have been a five star if the mounting would have been easier .	0
it is best to invest in a good set of makeup brushes .	oh ,  and it definitely works best to have one fan set to intake and one fan set to exhaust .	0
i am only giving this item num_num stars because of the absurd price .	i normally give good products num_num stars but because of the low price i m giving this num_num stars .	0
this does not appear to attract more mosquitos than the light does by itself .	this device does not appear to be any more accurate than my finger .	0
it almost fit ,  but not enough to snap completely together and fit .	if is all snap together .  .  . just make darn sure you snap it right the first time .	0
there is no menu selection for find free books .	there are no funny straps that hold it down on the corners ,  no magnets ,  no velcro ,  no elastic bands .	0
i will always have slight pain ,  no matter what .	it also came with another battery so i will always have an extra batter on hand no matter what .	0
the material that it is made of is like a dirt magnet .	the soft spongy material is supposed to be made of some kind of anti friction material and it works .	0
it works for maybe a few minutes and wears off quickly .	this machine makes the coffee very quickly and shuts itself off after a few minutes of sitting there .	0
the directions were easy to follow but the quality of the easel was pathetic .	we ve used this product once ,  the directions were a bit hard to follow but we figured it out .	0
waste of money ,  waste of time ,  waste of blood .	worth every penny ,  and i m going to get another one to keep in my art studio exclusively .	0
this case is far from what i expected .	the thickness of the case does protect the glass camera ,  but that was what i expected .	0
too bulky and there are better products out there in single units .	it was just too bulky and got tired of how bulky it was .	0
does not give me any confidence in buying any of the discovery kids toys .	kitchenaid has fabulous customer service ,  which gives me confidence in buying their products .	0
i would suggest a more tropical flavor with chilled water .	essentially ,  your water flavor must be good so you begin by using cold ,  filtered water .	0
old grandson loves all things that have to do with construction .	she loves the colors ,  loves the sparkle ,  and loves the great big bling hearts on back .	0
maybe a num_extend old girl could wear it .	fits num_extend num_extend num_extend num_extend num_extend num_extend and num_extend glass cover ,  num_extend dia .	0
so please stop buying this and maybe they will lower the price .	i normally grind ,  stop ,  shake ,  grind ,  stop ,  shake ,  grind ,  stop empty .	0
soe decided to push it to live a whole num_num weeks sooner than that .	call num_num num_num num_num num_num num_num num_num num_extend and it does .	0
it s not overpowering ,  it is not like perfume .	i like stainless steel cookware ,  like all clad ,  but i like everything else in my kitchen to be white .	0
num_extend has much better graphics ,  better sound ,  slightly better control .	fits num_extend num_extend num_extend num_extend num_extend num_extend and num_extend glass cover ,  num_extend dia .	0
also the headphones do not feel comfortable on your head .	: dthese headphones are also light weight and feel pretty comfortable .	0
claritin used to be the best thing around .	like spinning around in my chair at work ,  walking around outside ,  doing chores around the apartment .	0
it really is like they didn t take anything at all .	they fit ,  they work ,  they didn t cost much and they arrived quickly .	0

crayola makes the best crayons ,  don t get me wrong .	don t get me wrong ,  it has some heft ,  but not hurt your wrist kind of weight when empty .	0
perhaps it won t rust ,  but upclose it looks a little cheesey .	it looks like it won t do a good job ,  but looks are nt everything .	0
so i just thought maybe it ll help keep my acne away .	seriously ,  i ll just pick it up and put it back on the wall and it ll stick just fine .	0
its tollable but thats not the best thing to say about headphones .	i wouldn t say it s the best mixer ,  but its the best one for the price .	0
my dog has started to become anxious at bedtime .	i had no idea how dirty some areas of carpet had become until we started using this thing .	0
so after two months of use ,  working in it .	i got tired of my propane grills rusting out not working or partially working after a season or two .	0
i don t know why it has all the good reviews .	there are some bad reviews and good reviews but i look only with those good reviews which is true .	0
there were other vegetables included ,  but you really couldn t taste them .	other brands also looked good ,  but they were also quite astronomically expensive !  !  some were heavy and others were light .	0
the quality of materials and workmanship is noticeably less .	i don t know if its inherent quality  materials ,  workmanship  is really better or worse than the amazonbasics stylus .	0
i used this along with another similar product ,  for over num_num months .	over and over and over and over and over until the battery finally dies .	0
i don t think the saying  you get what you pay  .	there is a saying that you get what you pay for :  and this could not be truer .	0
if you want a cheaper sub deal with companies that specialize in that category .	otherwise ,  it s exactly what we wanted ,  for much cheaper than other companies sold it .	0
enfamil infant is characterized by choline and dha .	my droid doesn t care though and sucks power like an infant with a bottle .	0
you dont get so much sand with this .	non stick locking so they dont take up drawer space i dont know how i cooked without these .	0
if you get these just be a bit careful .	if you re looking for these kind of screen protectors ,  then just get these .	0
it reminds me more of silly putty than of a concealer .	in fact ,  it reminds me more of eggo waffles than belgian waffles . ok .	0
it worked for maybe num_num months then died .	it worked wonderfully ,  but it died within num_num months of purchasing it .	0
this is not at all expected from a respected brand like sony .	i like oxo brand ,  most of my kitchen utensils are oxo so i have come to trust the brand .	0
my goof to not research this brand more .	i had ordered this on my previous order ,  and it was my goof .	0
i found these patches very hard to put on .	i ve had them a week and i ve found it hard to put them down since .	0
i ve not been terribly impressed with this box .	i ve been using this headset extensively for about three weeks now and overall ,  i ve been surprisingly satisfied .	0
i will add an update if i ever figure it out .	this is a phone issue so i ll update the review if i ever figure this out . strongly recommended .	0
i tried hiding them in her food and in her treats .	we use it for a variety of dog treats ,  and it holds more than one snack box of treats .	0
she didn t like the handle of this one at all .	she didn t like it because she kept her phone in her purse or pocket .	0
well it made it worse like a rubber band texture .	they are very handsome ,  function well and even the rubber texture of the handset itself is pleasant .	0
i ll just stick with a good mayo and skip the bacon .	that bacon was not as flavorful as bacon cooked in the makin bacon rack .	0
thank heaven the operation is intuitive because there are no instructions .	there also were no instructions in the box ,  i had to search online for assembly instructions to print out .	0
i thought i was over charged once it was returned .	you will find yourself reading it over and over ,  makign flowers over and over .	0
i bought them and find them pretty annoying .	lost them ,  make sure u put them where u can find them .	0
after all the great reviews i thought i d give this a try .	nice size and great ,  great ,  great great ,  great ,  great great product .	0

you get what you pay for i guess .	i guess you get what you pay for .	0
it might work for all purpose flour ,  which has less gluten .	add the cake flour and stir slowly until all flour is moistened .	0
in my experience ,  they are a constant source of problems .	my samsung phone android experience was slightly different than my htc android phone experience .	0
disappointed as i expected to received candy that would last a long time .	like most of the cuisinart brand ,  it s built to last a long ,  long ,  long time .	0
the waist cords are over a foot long after being taken in .	it takes up approximately a foot by a foot and a half ,  and is a foot high .	0
so ,  this car looks cool and all but its not that great .	its very practical compact and does everything ,  only dfraw back is its pairing ,  but other than that its great .	0
i have no idea if it s me or this product doing .	no frills ,  no muss ,  no fuss ,  no george clooney ,  no pretty colors ,  no pods to throw out .	0

it was supposed to be a complete toy .	when it arrived i was disappointed the documentation and  how to use  info was not more complete .	0

quite tasteless and they make you order so many .	they are inexpensive ,  they fit ,  they work ,  they make you happy .	0
camera fell of it after a few uses .	this cutting board is pretty good but after a few uses i noticed a few splinters .	0

might have been nice ,  but just went over my cheeks .	you will find yourself reading it over and over ,  makign flowers over and over .	0
the shape of the grains makes all the difference .	the shape of the glass makes a difference ,  too .	0
first ,  without the extension they are very short .	the cord is thick but short ,  very short .	0
i then emptied th coffee grinder and looked for an obstruction ,  none .	therefore ,  my little blade grinder got converted to a spice grinder . the nicest feature on this grinder is its adjustability .	0
they have a medium pile lining that has more of a stiffer polyester feel .	the feel was nice and the inside has a lining that is very nice .	0
nightwolf s friendship is cool too where he juggles his hammers .	once he had real popcorn he couldn t go back to microwave but he s too cheap to purchase his own .	0
it s too bad because they look like they would keep my ears warm .	the ones that come with it would probably work ,  but they look like they would slip through the wall .	0
these salmons are in water not vegetable oil .	you can buy john boos mystery oil which is a mixture of mineral oil ,  linseed oil and tung oil .	0
when you place the eye brow attachment on you can get a mixed cut .	these glasses reduce eye strain and keep the humid air inside the lens to keep the eye lubricated .	0
i won t be buying any more in the future .	i would happily do business with them again in the future .	0
i hated the color that was sent to me ,  pale chalky beige .	i got the khaki color which is a very light beige color to match any decor .	0
