i can carry it in my pocket and use it when i need to .	the seidio case is also smooth enough that it can slip into a pocket for occasional pocket carry .	1
the tiny green light on one side is very bright when fully charged .	too small more like a purse and the green is not light green it s army green .	1
apparently there are thirteen more words required to successfully submit this review .	i am required to submit a review as i chose this product from the amazon vine program .	1
love it !  really handy to set by the stove .	anyway ,  the soundtrack is really european ,  really techno ,  and really ,  really bad .	1
adequately long cord . made in china ,  hence no reliability .	there are no spells ,  no feats ,  no skills ,  no races ,  no classes .	1
but this one does the job very nicely .	the snap closure works nicely ,  but the belt loop lacks any type of tactical disconnect .	1
i m a fan of symbian and find it easy to operate .	i m not exagerating . this fan is loud  !  !  !  forget about sleeping with this fan on at night .	1
plugs the ipad into my car and works great .	it does not specify ipad num_extend num_extend new ipad num_extend or new ipad num_extend	1
i m convinced vacuum sealing works just as advertised .	the product works just as advertised ,  charging my iphone to full a few times on one charge .	1
i like it better than any of the forman items .	i didn t find it worked any better than washing my face any other way .	1
i use this thing to core out the inside of a potato .	you will need to cut the potato ,  so you can cut the potato .	1
once it dies i will purchase a better unit .	i had to totally reconfigure the unit and purchase another one to replace the older unit that did work .	1
otterboxes are a little bulky ,  but nothing protects better for the price .	the fact that the manufacturer of this bar claims  nothing cooked and nothing processed  is nothing short of fraud .	1
this style of meat pounder is sort of commodity like .	i like my meat red ,  but not bleeding .   and the meat stuck on all the flips .	1
nice not to have a burner going for hours .	we could never get the num_extend btu burner to burn properly while the smaller burner is burning .	1
i can t believe i haven t owned one of these before .	i have owned two pair of these earphones now ,  one black and one white .	1
this unit makes the best french fries i ve ever made .	this unit rates as one of the worst purchases i ve ever made .	1
it s probably my phone but it happens constantly since i got the battery .	so since my husband got my droid phone ,  i gave him this charger .	1
it works with all types ,  but works best with roma tomatoes .	these tomatoes taste no better than branded canned us tomatoes regularly available in our supermarkets today .	1
careful when using steak knives however because they will scratch these plates .	there are num_num bottom plates num_extend options  ,  num_num top plates num_extend options  ,  and num_num head plates num_extend options  .	1
just wipe the plates with a paper towel .	it has removable plates for cleaning and also has plates for sandwich melts etc .	1
i can t believe that i didn t buy these sooner .	if you want to buy grand theft auto num_extend just buy it; dont buy xbox s lame version .	1
the recipe that comes with it is tasty .	the brownies ,  horrible !  !  a recipe that normally makes delicious brownies turned out flat and not very tasty .	1
it s still going great ,  i just needed more capacity .	maybe that s just duke s thing ,  i dunno ,  but this game needed more ,  much more . the levels all seem too alike .	1
also ,  the knife is easy to maneuver despite its length .	i bought this knife due to its length  i m forbidden from carrying anything longer than num_num inches in public  .	1
i have no doubt that it will hold up well through the years .	i have no doubt this knife would hold up well under a lot of use .	1
i had two problems ,  one caused the rating to num_num num_extend	i prefer sorghum num_extend almond num_extend millet num_extend tapioca num_extend arrowroot num_extend coconut num_extend and brown rice num_extend	1
it stays on and i unplug it when it s done .	no problem right ?  the sync finished ,  and i went to unplug ,  except it wouldn t unplug .	1
for the price ,  this is a good buy .	i recommend the potential buy either pay the full price for the nore expensive model or buy something else .	1
i had a less powerful one for num_num years before it finally gave out .	i had to go back and purchase a blow dryer that had a less powerful motor .	1
and it s a bread knife and nothing all that special .	the fact that the manufacturer of this bar claims  nothing cooked and nothing processed  is nothing short of fraud .	1
no need to find storage place because it fits in any shallow drawer .	there are no spells ,  no feats ,  no skills ,  no races ,  no classes .	1
i used to use a good cooks brand safety opener and really liked it .	i however really would rather have had a flip top safety than the twist safety .	1
then both of them go into the dishwasher .	you peel a couple of vegetables ,  then chop them ,  then fry them with a shake of the wiimote .	1
i love my lodge omelet pan and use it almost every morning .	my daughter love love love the toy story movies .	1
tablets charge slowly ,  but that s to be expected .	at first ,  it would charge ,  not charge ,  charge ,  not charge .	1
however signal between transmitter and receiver does not work between insulated patio glass door .	i installed it in straight line with no obstruction between the transmitter and receiver .	1
this pan i have had for one year .	i have two pair of these ,  one from last year and one my sister gave me this year .	1
i do seem to need to invest in some better popcorn .	do i have to waste some to find out if this is correct ?  c mon willpowder ,  you can do better .	1
bento spoon and the boker knife which is quite nice .	the page description for the small spoon says num_num inches ,  while the spoon is only num_num inches long .	1
really confused ppl riding with me at first .	the fact that kettle foods claims their products are  all natural  really ,  really ,  really upsets me .	1
i finally made he purchase and am glad i did .	i was worried about the purchase because of all the negative reviews but i am glad i did .	1
i can t remember when i first bought this timer .	but once you ve stuck the magnet to the timer ,  the timer weight is too much for the magnet strength .	1
it does not slip all over the place when using .	it s all over my floors ,  whereas other litters don t seem to make it all over the place .	1
coming from an asian background it s not something we normally cook with .	the icon cut out the background sound almost % while the others still let background noise through .	1
it should reconnect easily when you are in the num_extend	i have owned the num_extend htc touch num_extend htc num_extend nokia num_extend nokia num_extend nokia num_extend and apple iphone .	1
now i just need to buy a catch can for the bottle tops .	if you want to buy grand theft auto num_extend just buy it; dont buy xbox s lame version .	1
i have had to replace the paddles as they wore out .	they give you a good quality product until they get their name out and then replace it with rubbish .	1
i liked this and was happy with my purchase .	i liked girardelli ,  i liked jelly beans ,  i do not think i liked anything else ,  not even salmon .	1
we juiced our garden lettuce and greens with ease .	i purchased the aqua garden along with the platinum fountain and num_num refills for the garden .	1
anyway i recommend this one for its price and quality .	i found a similar  much better quality  one locally for the same price as this one .	1
i put my kitchen appliances through the ringer .	build through power ,  build through peace and build through pure frustration .	1
i have been missing out !  this thing is so sharp .	i ve done the support thing ,  i ve done the experiment thing ,  i ve done the newsgroups thing .	1
it is easy to clean ,  but honestly i rarely clean it .	i am usually not one to complain ,  rarely ,  very ,  rarely ,  but this is just not good .	1
hand graters can be a mess to clean ,  especially under the handle .	their stand mixers are the undisputed champs ,  but kitchenaid s hand graters are of a different and inadequate caliber .	1
you have to break it in ,  in other words .	in other words ,  the juice can charge at most two devices :  a notebook ,  plus one other small gadget .	1
the price was good ,  and came quickly though my prime membership .	sorry ,  but that s nowhere near acceptable for a cable of this price  even though the price was good  .	1
for my purpose this is the perfect item .	gluing ruins the purpose of these ponies; but since the purpose never worked ,  it doesn t really matter .	1
we both use the blackberry num_num curve ,  which each use bluetooth version num_extend	i prefer sorghum num_extend almond num_extend millet num_extend tapioca num_extend arrowroot num_extend coconut num_extend and brown rice num_extend	1
great case ,  easy to use and very durable .	very , very ,  very ,  very hard balls terrible !  !  !  ! if these hit someone they would hurt like crazy .	1
need a cheap car charger and it seems to do the job .	while it couldnt do the job that the big expensive blenders do it does an ok job .	1
i recently purchased  white rice  popcorn for my dad who has diverticulitious .	but white rice also gives me tummy trouble and this is made mostly of white rice .	1
have been using it daily since it arrived .	however ,  i do have sensitive skin so that might be the reason .	1
this casserole dish is the perfect size and i love having a nice lid .	this casserole dish is designed to break ,  and it will eventually .	1
unless you have very small or very large hands it is comfortable to use .	you ll be done much faster . unless you have very small hands .	1
i have both a square and round pan i use this with .	you can beat the game just hitting square ,  square ,  square .	1
i have never had a pleasant experience with the customer support at cuisnart .	i called customer support multiple times ,  but they never returned my call when they promised .	1
much to my dismay ,  the invisishield was nothing but garbage .	much to my dismay ,  the coffee i thought was so great tastes terrible .	1
we love that it can go straight from the stove top to the oven .	this stove will not bloom unless you completely fuel the stove .	1
it creates heaping folds of foam andturns your coffee into a breve latte .	puroast low acid coffee low acid coffee french roast is not a coffee that i will try again .	1
i never thought about making cheese until ree drummond made some on her show .	did not leave it with her ,  in her crate; we played with her and tried to manage her chewing .	1
i though it would be faster and easier but it wasn t .	a cutting board and knife would be faster and easier to clean than this plastic thing .	1
it seems to be of very good quality in its build .	for the price ,  the build quality seems good .	1
i have smaller bt headsets that last num_num hours longer .	it lasted num_num hours ,  num_num hours the first day and another num_num hours the second day .	1
may be it will become soft with use and then it should be fine .	the screw become really difficult to use after continuous use ,  and then eventually failed .	1
it is the handiest thing for slicing potatoes for scalloped potatoes and chips .	no ,  i really must not be sucked into buying these awful scalloped potatoes again .	1
i have been using one for nearly num_num years .	i have been using clinique products almost exclusively for nearly num_num years .	1
researched before i bought it and had actually chosen another one .	i actually bought another one to replace this one . and here s num_extend	1
it keeps it the coffee hot and fresh for hours .	it lasted num_num hours ,  num_num hours the first day and another num_num hours the second day .	1
if you need a pot with this capacity num_extend qts  buy this one .	with switch price so low ,  buy a switch instead of this one . size :  num_extend num_extend num_extend of use :  num_extend	1
more creative than num_extend dont think so !  but still a great product .	lots of num_extend they walk like num_extend the weapons dont do num_extend they dont bleed .	1
its like that showtime rotisserrie oven ,  you set it and forget it .	it did not taste like vanilla ,  amazon said its a returnable item so its on its way back .	1
this is what s affordable right now ,  so it has to do .	it s so great ,  and now ,  it s so affordable to buy on amazon separately from the whole proactiv set .	1
i followed the guidance and am grateful for it .	my pharmacist stopped me from making this mistake and i am so grateful to him for it !  .	1
in particular ,  the coating on this cookware has been cheapened .	it has been unreliable and performance has been inconsistent .	1
fits perfectly ,  cutouts are plsced where they should be .	they should have stayed where they were and bumped up the price some .	1
i ve only charged it once since i bought it .	i ve only had to empty the canister once since i have owned it .	1
i also like the adjustable heat option for the warming plate .	the top plate does not heat equal to the bottom and neither heat as well as the older models .	1
i still have privacy screen ,  after num_num months .	one stopped holding a charge after num_num months and the other after num_num months .	1
it it pretty hardy ,  i haven t broken it yet .	i haven t taken it for a full month yet but i haven t noticed any improvements at all yet .	1
i will update my review after num_num months .	below is my review from christmas num_num but here is another review after few months .  .  . march num_extend	1
i purchased two to mount horizontally under the shelves of my kitchen island .	it allows you to mount it horizontally or vertically .	1
also cheaper than going to the grocery store .	so ,  in the end it was actually cheaper than heather s and cheaper than buying it from whole foods .	1
no complaints and my wife loves the color .	we won t be buying any more of this decaf .	1
i m not sure why this grinder got so many mixed reviews .	not sure how this got so many num_num and num_num star reviews .	1
these small cookie scoops made perfectly uniform two inch cookies .	on about half of the cookies ,  the lower cookie half had separated from the top half of the cookie .	1
voice command is better on this set than other ones i ve tried .	this shampoo and condition due doesn t seem to be any better than any other that i ve tried .	1
these tongs seem to have the locking mechanism backwards .	replace the rope and don t think about the locking mechanism and you have a fairly decent lift setup .	1
get it ,  it s worth the price for sure .	be sure to check out immediately if you want to get the price you found .	1
there is no warming plate in the unit but it doesn t need one .	there are no spells ,  no feats ,  no skills ,  no races ,  no classes .	1
things i notice so far : + bluetooth num_extend streaming is solid .	i have owned the num_extend htc touch num_extend htc num_extend nokia num_extend nokia num_extend nokia num_extend and apple iphone .	1
i use it charge my batteries since my usb port is not an option .	at first ,  it would charge ,  not charge ,  charge ,  not charge .	1
fasy to keep clean and a real treasure .	you can use a clean piece of cloth to clean your disk .	1
just make sure that you don t misplace the spout stopper .	don t misplace that manual ! oh ,  and then there s the problem that it was dead within a year .	1
i received them as a christmas present and i love them .	i received this game as a christmas present  gee ,  what a crappy gift  back in the late num_extend	1
it did what it was supposed to do .	it did not live up to what it was supposed to do .	1
put num_num quart of water into the machine .	if you re into espresso s ,  not a bad buy; into latte s or capuccinos ,  not really the machine for you .	1
this keeps the cord out of the way and above the board .	thanks ! prosac or dc poweredconsac cord is way too shortair hose is way too short .	1
i use is for more than deep frying .	but there are more than num_num bad reviews ,  and the word  explosion  was mentioned more than once .	1
i sprinkle a little flour on the rolls before stamping to prevent sticking .	i tried to sprinkle flour as it came out but it was difficult ,  since the strands hung straight down .	1
it was the finger next to his hole finger .	one hole was clearly melted so it would not fray out ,  another hole was on the seam .	1
it s almost like putting the phone into a high end pair of socks .	my high end knives dont get used much .  . they are just too high end to risk losing or abusing .	1
we are ice cream lovers and fussy about the quality of ice cream .	yes ,  in theory ,  it can make ice cream ,  but not the ice cream that s worth the time and effort .	1
also these attachment pieces are very easy to clean .	the pieces that weren t broken  and the larger pieces that broke off  were also pretty poor quality .	1
only negative was delifery was num_num days late .	it was a at least num_num days late i missed the full moon and i an pissed about it .	1
i just received a replacement bb curve from verizon .	received num_extend replacement today and it is the same as the num_extend replacement .	1
oh ,  and the battery life is pretty decent .	the life of this battery is equal to or less than the life of the original battery .	1
i dropped phone once and the case held up perfectly .	third day of the case being on the phone ,  he dropped it onto his desk and the case split .	1
i installed this on a horizantaly sliding window .	it is now on window sill of window construct of metal .	1
love this mixer ,  wasn t near as loud as some were saying .	graphics are no where near as good as they were saying they would be .	1
these wine stoppers are very inexpensive and certainly do the job .	these do not do a very good job at that .	1
it makes it easy and neat to store and access all of your scarves .	all have been virtually identical in size both length and diameter from store to store .	1
glad i went for this one over some of the less expensive ones .	there are less weapons ,  less vehicles ,  less options ,  and less of a sandbox .	1
cleans up nice and cooks waffles in a reasonable amount of time .	i did not receive this product in a reasonable amount of time .	1
short blades and longer handles give you the leverage you need for tough cutting .	as water pressure builds up in the hose ,  it gets longer and longer and longer .	1
and it s much much cheaper than getting it at the cusinart parts site .	the equate cleanser is so much better and much cheaper at less than $ a bottle .	1
then into my phone and it chargers my phone .	this did not unbrick my phone or did not bring my phone into download mode .	1
great dutch oven ,  works well and fun to use on camping trips .	fun fun fun . all of this for a rediculous price of num_num dollars a month .	1
the otterbox defender series is by far the best available .	before you buy this case ,  be advised that the white iphone num_num is incompatible with otterbox defender series cases .	1
this turner has worked well for the last few years .	this scale worked well for a while but after a few years it died .	1
but i like the phone to be up higher on the windshield . recommended .	the phone was delivered on time ,  but it seemed like a refurbished phone ,  because the side cover was loose .	1
heavy ,  patterned glass ,  and very classy looking on the table .	my son puts his microwave on the inside table ,  and sits on the oustide table ,  gives him more room .	1
i have not been able to stop using it .	maybe i could stop using wen and go back to shampooing and using this but i probably won t .	1
however ,  slicing up tons of veggies can be quite time consuming .	however ,  sometimes i just need to do it myself and the tweezers are time consuming .	1
i mainly use my blentec now but haven t sold the vitamix yet .	i think i ll just use my vitamix to grind up everything from now on .	1
i was glad to see it was still available .	so if your not in that age range .  .  .  . skip this game . it is dull ,  repetitive ,  uninspired .	1
very easy to put on ,  no bubbles whatsoever .	air bubbles ,  bubbles ,  bubbles !  they are just unavoidable and impossible to get rid of ,  for me at least .	1
i can see i will be using it a lot .	i didn t see much difference using this product or my all natural cream i ve been using .	1
i was concerned for the price that these measuring cups would be flimsy .	those of us concerned with such things as human rights and the american economy are concerned about such omissions .	1
the complication is the heft of the phone .	i don t need that kind of complication from a silly coffee maker .	1
i have owned it for two years and it is a work horse .	bought two of these tires they came from two different sellers from two different locations .	1
i used this set with a toaster oven and with a coleman camping oven .	i just bought this dutch oven for the usual things but also as an oven for baking while camping .	1
i bought the lowest priced model more to test the brand than anything else .	i m not mad i bought it but it is more musk than anything else .	1
you place all the ingredients into the bread maker .	the toaster works well with store bread but not with bread made in a bread machine .	1
my dish feels very solid to the touch .	for my ipod touch ,  there is no slot ,  so the stylus is in my pocket ,  not with the touch .	1
this is definitely not the case with the num_extend	i have owned the num_extend htc touch num_extend htc num_extend nokia num_extend nokia num_extend nokia num_extend and apple iphone .	1
i don t know how i ever managed without this handy devise .	now i am in seach of another cat food without the clay without the carrageenan ,  without msb .	1
but these knives are well worth their price .	their passion for their grass is second only to their family .	1
the loops stop any accidently lost or intentional disappearance .	the cream does it s job well ,  it s moistureisez my dry skin ,  but do not expect any wrinkle disappearance miracle .	1
i bought this to grind xylitol and truvia sweeteners into a powder for cooking .	i followed all the techniques :  bought the powder ,  bought the sponge ,  bought the fan brush .	1
we usually run it on low and it is relatively quite .	usually resulting in a crash unless you re quite fast and quite good on the stick .	1
it charges my phone very quickly and to full % battery .	in very plain words ,  this product dried my skin out very very quickly .	1
well worth the money ,  wouldn t want to be without it .	it partially installed ,  but wouldn t erase and wouldn t run the keyboard or mouse .	1
i will never have a phone without an otterbox again .	i had a similar issue with an otterbox case on a past phone and otterbox was all over it .	1
then i thought something was wrong with my car .	i thought something was wrong with my phone at first .	1
that is sufficiently minor as to not affect my rating .	but while that s disappointing ,  it wouldn t really affect my rating .	1
because it s made of cast iron ,  scorching is minimized .	i wish this game was never made because it made atari look stupid .	1
i imagine it will make soups even better than the old one as well .	the dvd player works well ,  but having an old ,  unknown brand vhs player working better than a toshiba .  .  . that s sad .	1
very nice unit ,  easy to assemble and operate .	overall i am very satisfied with the unit ,  once i learned how to operate it .	1
simple !  does the job it was intended for .	it was sticky and didn t do the job it was intended for .	1
i ve been using this for months ,  and like it very much .	i ve been using the best foods light mayonnaise product and liking it very much .	1
it works as advertised so i m happy !   :   .	and so on ,  and so on ,  and so on ,  and so on .	1
item arrived in num_num days in bulk packaging exactly like j .	it lasted for num_num days for the first num_num days ,  now it s just like my old battery .	1
for the size ,  weight and price it is really worth it .	anyway ,  the soundtrack is really european ,  really techno ,  and really ,  really bad .	1
i just flipped the pan over ,  and there they were .	we just selected subject cards and then flipped over a letter card and went from there .	1
it holds the charge like when my phone was brand new .	it was allegedly brand new . it came without a charge and wouldn t charge up .	1
i would recommend this case to my friends .	however these big ones my dog ,  my friends dog ,  and my neighbors dog hated .	1
the same panel buttons are there but in a better placement .	there are better ones out there that clean your scalp better for the same price .	1
all my testing proves the same . hope that helps .	alpha testing is in house testing prior to beta testing .	1
all in all ,  though ,  happy with the product .	i m super happy with the koss portapro ,  but not all that happy with these .	1
finish is great ,  and it makes great french toast .	trying to find the right pair with a great sound ,  great comfort ,  and great price .	1
they get into the corners as described and are flexible yet firm .	it is hard to get into the box corners and does not fit in most scoop holders .	1
hope this lasts longer than my last grinder so can buy as a gift .	i planned to buy gift cards for the unit so the kids could buy books .	1
i have had mine for almost two years and they have not frayed .	but now ,  two years later and two clothes sizes smaller i tried them again and they still don t fit .	1
with grandchildren ,  this is the perfect combination of colorful and functional .	however ,  the combination dials are almost impossible to turn without hurting your thumb ,  and i couldn t reset the combination .	1
it s also a good size for a family of num_extend	num_extend per serving and also got num_extend num_extend as num_extend serving is full dose !  also check ur protein ct .	1
i could not tell a difference at all .	i used this but could not tell any difference in the shine .	1
i have been using this grill for num_num years .	num_num cats are over num_num years old and num_num are under num_num years old .	1
i like the oster steamer ,  it does everything it claim to do .	the first thing i noticed is ,  oster is no longer made by oster .	1
i would not suggest this on black iphones .	the screen would go black and i would have to take the case off just to end the call .	1
it is close to the old one i had for years .	num_num cats are over num_num years old and num_num are under num_num years old .	1
one to another company and two to amazon . com .	dear slik company , i purchased two slik num_num ball head attachments six months ago from amazon . com .	1
the knife got a tad rusty after running it through a cycle .	old desktop running windows xp ,  a new pc running windows num_num and a notebook running windows num_extend	1
i think the sensor is reading carpet fibers its sucking up as dirt .	that said the hoover doesn t pull up so many carpet fibers and track them around .	1
no problems with this and worked with many devices .	num_extend and causes cancer , kidney problems , lung problems , liver problems , and mucous membrane problems .	1
either you will like it ,  or you won t .	it now won t charge ,  it won t turn on and won t work ,  period .	1
puts together very easily and does what it s said it would .	as other reviewers have said ,  these scratch easily  more easily than your lcd would without them  .	1
i really like how this counter protector curves over the edge of the counter .	you attack and counter button are the same and you don t even really need to play your counter attacks .	1
trash cans are pretty unexciting ,  but this one is awfully nice .	out the num_num cans i received ,  there were about num_num cans that were dented pretty badly .	1
much better than block and tackle type hooks to store overhead .	this also has more than the num_num hooks pictured and the extra hooks catch .	1
it is not difficult to clean or assemble .	not only is the sheath difficult to clean ,  you have to be worried about what you clean it num_extend	1
this pan is a bit heavier and truly nonstick .	i truly expected better for this game ,  since it was based on a truly cool ,  badass movie .	1
i can hear the caller clearly ,  vice versa .	on one we could hear the caller but caller did not hear anything .	1
only issue is the blue light it becomes a annoying after a while .	when the box is opened ,  i found a lighter blue .  .  . not primary bright blue ,  more like a williamsburg blue .	1
we have tried a few recipes and had fun with them .	i thought they d have fun with them but after a few unsuccessful tries no one played with them .	1
take the whole thing out in the sink .	the long load times really take away from the games and just makes the whole thing a bad experience .	1
this salad spinner is durable and easy to use .	i ll wait until someone comes out with one that is both thin and durable .	1
i wouldn t trade them but this is a great knife for the price .	price price price !  now with that said let s go over the bad .	1
it s very easy to use and very dependable .	very , very ,  very ,  very hard balls terrible !  !  !  ! if these hit someone they would hurt like crazy .	1
it moves plenty of air ,  oscillating between two rooms .	when set up ,  the two units would be in separate rooms with a hallway between them .	1
i ve owned this crock pot for several years .	i ve owned my transmitter for several years now .	1
if you want loud get the cdn num_extend count down big digit timer .	if you want to get num_extend but havent played num_extend get num_extend	1
then i used the attachemnts on my furniture and the water was gray .	i then warmed the mix and water; i used extra water and warmed it up in the microwave .	1
i think this case is a very nice phone case .	the phone is very nice with very cool features however ,  nokia num_extend is quite better than this phone .	1
anker is a fine product though i d never heard of it .	i ve heard parts of songs that i d never heard before .	1
the unit itself rests like a necklace around your neck .	the dock itself seems like its well built  from the outside  and the phone rests very well on it .	1
the item was what i was looking for and arrived exactly as described .	it was so pretty and was exactly what i was looking for .	1
the braun has it all . this is my second programmable flavorselect .	that braun electric razor that was closest to my last one was the braun freecontrol num_extend	1
i would definitely recommend this for a cute case .	cute while it lasted .  .  . so if you want to have a num_num night stand case ,  this is your case .	1
but the back side looks nice as well .	this set looks nice ,  but on close inspection the set looks very inexpensive .	1
i bought three of these units to place in our home .	all computer controlled units are roughly two to three times as accurate as your  supposedly elite  mercenary units .	1
and that would be what you would need .	but what gets me is the sheer lack of need to really control what s going on .	1
it works fine and the coffee is just as great !  .	it works in coffee ,  especially really strong coffee where the coffee can over power the bad num_extend	1
it basically picks up what is directly in front of it .	you basically wind up figuring out the most effective attacks ,  then ignore beefing up any other special abilities .	1
pretty much all i ask for in a grinder .	this causes the grinder to accumulate all the steam from brewing ,  thus leaving the grinder completely saturated .	1
